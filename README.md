# Coding Quiz
Bootcamp Week 4 - A coding quiz using vanilla JS

## Purpose
This is a quiz application designed to show 5 questions about basic JavaScript to the user which has to be completed within 60 seconds, losing 10 seconds for each incorrect answer. If the user is able to complete the quiz successfully, they will be asked to save their time with their name to local storage. 

## Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Contributions & Attribution
All of the code in this project was written by James Prince.

## Challenges
With this challenge, I have attempted to make this as extensible as possibe so that if/when more questions are added, they are automatically put into rotation. If an insufficient number of questions are provided, the quiz will allow repeats. 
I have randomised the questions presented to the user in addition to this.

Due to my relative unfamiliarity with both JavaScript and effective software design structures as well as the time constraints of this exercise, I am not entirely satisfied with the quality of the code. When reviewing and refactoring the code, I am not entirely certain the best way to proceed to both simplify the code and increase its readability. It is functional in its current state and has been commented extensively. 

## Notes
Please forgive the humour in the questions. This would not be a quiz written by me without a little joke here and there.
